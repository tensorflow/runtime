# TFRT: A New TensorFlow Runtime

TFRT is a new TensorFlow runtime. It aims to provide a unified, extensible
infrastructure layer with best-in-class performance across a wide variety of
domain specific hardware. It provides efficient use of multithreaded host CPUs,
supports fully asynchronous programming models, and focuses on low-level
efficiency.

TFRT will benefit a broad range of users, but it will be of particular interest
to you if you are a:

*   Researcher looking to experiment with complex new models and add custom
    operations to TensorFlow
*   Application developer looking for improved performance when serving models
    in production
*   Hardware maker looking to plug hardware into TensorFlow, including edge and
    datacenter devices

...or you are simply curious about cool ML infrastructure and low-level runtime
technology!

To learn more about TFRT’s early progress and wins, check out our
[Tensorflow Dev Summit 2020 presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15tiQoPpuZ8)
where we provided a performance benchmark for small-batch GPU inference on
ResNet 50, and our
[MLIR Open Design Deep Dive presentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fkLJuVP-tIk4GENBu2AgemF3oXYGr2PB)
where we provided a detailed overview of TFRT’s core components, low-level
abstractions, and general design principles.

**Note:** TFRT is an early stage project and is not yet ready for general use.

## Getting started

**TLDR:** This section describes how to set up a development environment for
TFRT, as well as instructions to build and test TFRT components.

TFRT currently supports Ubuntu-16.04. Future supported platforms include MacOS,
Windows, etc. Bazel and clang are required to build and test TFRT.

To describe the TFRT build and test workflows, we will build and run the
following binaries for graph execution.

Recall from our Dev Summit presentation that for graph execution, a TensorFlow
user passes into TFRT a TensorFlow graph created via high-level TensorFlow APIs,
and TFRT then calls the [MLIR](https://www.tensorflow.org/mlir)-based graph
compiler to optimize and lower the graph into
[BEF](documents/binary_executable_format.md), a Binary Executable Format for
TFRT graph execution (MLIR is the compiler infrastructure that we use to
represent TFRT host programs). The blue arrows in the simplified TensorFlow
training stack diagram below show this flow.

</div>

The two binaries introduced next focus on the backend of the graph execution
workflow. After the graph compiler has optimized the TensorFlow graph and
produced a low-level TFRT Host Program represented in MLIR, `tfrt_translate`
generates a `BEF` file from that host program and `bef_executor` runs the `BEF`
file. The progression from TFRT Host Program to `bef_executor` via
`tfrt_translate` is depicted in the expanded TensorFlow training stack diagram
below. Note that the blue arrow between TFRT Host Program and `BEF` file
represents `tfrt_translate`. Both programs are built in the `tools` directory.

</div>

#### tfrt_translate

The `tfrt_translate` program does round trip translation between MLIR and BEF,
similar to an assembler and disassembler.

#### bef_executor

The `bef_executor` program is the execution driver of `BEF` files. It reads in a
`BEF` file, sets up runtime, and asynchronously executes function(s) in that
file.

### Prerequisites

#### Install Bazel

To build TFRT, you need to install Bazel. TFRT is built and verified with Bazel
2.0.0 to 3.1.0. Follow
[the Bazel installation instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html)
to install Bazel. Verify the installation with

```shell
$ bazel --version
bazel 3.1.0
```

#### Install clang

Follow [the clang installation instructions](https://apt.llvm.org/) to install
clang. The automatic installation script that installs clang, lldb, and lld, is
recommended. TFRT is built and verified with 9.0.0 and above.

If you have multiple versions of clang installed, ensure that the correct
version of clang is the default. On Ubuntu based systems, you can use
`update-alternatives` to select the default version. The following example
commands assume you installed clang-9:

```shell
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-9 9
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-9 9
```

Verify the installation with

```shell
$ clang --version
clang version 9.0.1-6
```

#### Install libstdc++

TFRT requires libstdc++8 or greater. Check clang's selected version with

```shell
$ clang++ -v |& grep "Selected GCC"
Selected GCC installation: /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9
```

In the example above, the *9* at the end of the path indicates that clang will
use libstdc++<em>9</em>, which is compatible with TFRT.

If you need to upgrade, the easiest way is to install gcc-8. Run the following
command to install:

```shell
$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y gcc-8 g++-8
```

To verify installation, re-run the `clang++ -v` check above.

### Building and running TFRT

To build TFRT, `cd` to the root directory (where `WORKSPACE` file is located) of
the TFRT workspace. A set of build configurations is in `.bazelrc` file. You can
create a `user.bazelrc` in the repository root with extra bazel configs that may
be useful. Build `tfrt_translate` and `bef_executor` with the following
commands:

```shell
$ bazel build -c opt //tools:bef_executor
$ bazel build -c opt //tools:tfrt_translate
```

The above commands build the binaries with `opt` compilation mode. Check
[Bazel's documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#build-options)
for more build options. Bazel will notify the output location at the end of a
successful build (default is `bazel-bin`).

After `tfrt_translate` and `bef_executor` are built, run an `.mlir` program with
the following command:

```shell
$ bazel-bin/tools/tfrt_translate -mlir-to-bef path/to/program.mlir | bazel-bin/tools/bef_executor
```

TFRT provides a series of .mlir test programs. For example:

```shell
$ bazel-bin/tools/tfrt_translate -mlir-to-bef mlir_tests/bef_executor/async.mlir | bazel-bin/tools/bef_executor
```

Any output will be printed out to the terminal.

### Testing

TFRT utilizes LLVM’s [LIT](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html)
infrastructure and
[FileCheck](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html) utility tool to
construct MLIR-based check tests. These tests verify that some set of string
tags appear in the test’s output. More introduction and guidelines on testing
can be found
[here](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/TestingGuide/#check-tests). An
example test is shown below:

```c++
// RUN: tfrt_translate -mlir-to-bef %s | bef_executor | FileCheck %s
// RUN: tfrt_opt %s | tfrt_opt

// CHECK-LABEL: --- Running 'basic_tensor'
func @basic_tensor() {
  %c0 = hex.new.chain

  %a = dht.create_uninitialized_tensor.i32.2 [3 : i64, 2 : i64]
  %c1 = dht.fill_tensor_with_constant.i32 %a, %c0 0 : i32

  // CHECK: shape = [3, 2], values = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  %c2 = dht.print_tensor %a, %c1

  hex.return
}
```

To run a test, simply invoke `bazel test`:

```shell
$ bazel test -c opt //mlir_tests/bef_executor:basics.mlir.test
```

Suites of MLIR tests are placed under three directories:

*   `./mlir_tests` which include tests for core TFRT components and core
    kernels;
*   `./backends/common/mlir_tests, ./backends/cpu/mlir_tests` which includes
    tests for CPU Ops.

To run the test suites, run the following command:

```shell
$ bazel test -c opt <path/to/test/suite>:all
```

where the path to the test suite is one of the above.

To run all CPU tests:

```shell
$ bazel test -c opt //... -- -//third_party/...
```

where `-//third_party/...` excludes tests specified in build files for
third_party repositories.
